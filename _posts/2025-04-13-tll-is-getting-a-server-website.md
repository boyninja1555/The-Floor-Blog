title: The Lord's Land Is Getting a Server Website!
layout: post

A slightly new Minecraft server is currently being made! While being close to publishing date, the website is hardly finished! What will BennySpaghetti do? Of course, Benny hires me! Even though I don't know how much I'm getting paid, I'm still working non-stop on the site. And what does Benny say?

**Success!** I have pleased the server owner. Plus, I get to enjoy telling 'Spaghetti how extreme the cost of a website backend can get xD!!! The best part, the complexity of this site will give me ***TONS*** of *$$$*!!!
## The Only Downside of Making the Website
Well there's the time limit, the extreme complexity, and SpaghettiBenny's expectations. Even though they're not that high, It's still a lot for a short amount of time. Have you noticed how I've changed BennySpaghetti's name throughout this entire article? Well, it sounded kind of repetitive. In fact, this entire article has turned into a post about a Mnecraft server owner.
