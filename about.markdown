**The Floor Blog** started as a joke, and it still is. **There we go!** *End of story!*

What's that? You want an actual **About Page**? Too bad! I'm too lazy to write a page nobody will ever read. You came here for the articles, right? Even though the *layout I selected* is set to **post**, it really means nothing if there's no story/detailed writing here. If you want to know more about **The Floor Blog**, then check the bottom of the site, genius!
